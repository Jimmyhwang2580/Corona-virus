# Project Overview

## Project Name

Corona-Virus Tracker

## Project Description

This is where you track the Corona-Virus from different country. For example. Mexico and Canada are our nearest countries, we can see how many people have the disease, deaths, population, percent and country.

## API and Data Sample

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Create HTML/CSS/JavaScript for user interface to query search and display country
- Axios call on API
- Implement responsive design (possibly using Flexbox or Grid)
- Clear earlier query results when creating a new search

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Second API call for more information about the country

- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Students usally put in around 40+ hours into their project 1.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

|     Component        | Priority  | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
       HTML                H             10hrs
JS Event Listeners         M             4hrs
    Javascript             H             10hrs
    General CSS            M             12hrs
  Responsive CSS           H             8hrs
2nd API Implementation     M             5hrs

     Total
